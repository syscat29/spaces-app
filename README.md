## Learning Assignment: Build a Simple Event Space Platform

### Objective
Build a minimal event space listing platform using the Localy stack: Next.js 16, TypeScript, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS. This assignment covers core patterns without admin/host/user features.

---

### Tech Stack Overview

**Core Technologies:**
- **Next.js 16** (App Router) - React framework with server components
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Supabase** - PostgreSQL database with real-time features
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Clean Architecture** - Layered architecture pattern (OPTIONAL)

---

### Minimum Viable Project Requirements

Build a simple platform where users can:
1. View a list of event spaces (homepage)
2. View individual space details
3. Filter spaces by city
4. Search spaces by name

**No authentication, no booking, no admin panel** - just read-only public pages.

### Things to Do


Project Setup
- [ ] Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Install Supabase dependencie
- [ ] Set up environment variables for Supabase connection
- [ ] Organize project folders (you can choose your own structure)

Database Setup
- [ ] Create a Supabase project
- [ ] Design and create a `spaces` table with necessary fields (id, title, description, city, capacity, price, images, etc.)
- [ ] Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies to allow public read access
- [ ] Insert 5-10 sample spaces for testing


Presentation Layer - Pages
- [ ] Create a homepage that displays all spaces
- [ ] Create a dynamic route for space detail pages (`/spaces/[id]`)
- [ ] Ensure pages use use cases (not repositories directly)
- [ ] Handle loading and error states appropriately
- [ ] Use Next.js metadata API for SEO

Presentation Layer - Components
- [ ] Create a `SpaceCard` component to display space previews
- [ ] Create a `SpaceDetail` component to display full space information
- [ ] Determine which components need to be client components (`"use client"`) and why and when we use "use server"
- [ ] Use Next.js Image component for optimized images
- [ ] Make components responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)

Styling & Polish
- [ ] Customize Tailwind configuration with brand colors
- [ ] Create a header/navigation component
- [ ] Add loading states (skeletons or spinners)
- [ ] Add proper error handling and error messages
- [ ] Ensure all pages are fully responsive
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes

Search & Filtering (Basic Features)
- [ ] Add a search input on the homepage
- [ ] Implement search functionality that filters spaces by name/title
- [ ] Add a city filter dropdown or buttons
- [ ] Update URL parameters when filters are applied (optional)

### Success Criteria

Your project is complete when:
- ✅ Homepage displays all spaces in a grid layout
- ✅ Clicking a space navigates to its detail page
- ✅ Space detail page shows all space information correctly
- ✅ Search functionality filters spaces by name/title
- ✅ City filter works and shows only spaces from selected city
- ✅ All pages are responsive (work on mobile, tablet, and desktop)
- ✅ No TypeScript errors or warnings no use of any
- ✅ All data comes from Supabase (no hardcoded data)
- ✅ Images load correctly and are optimized
- ✅ Error states are handled gracefully (404 for missing spaces, etc.)
- ✅ Loading states provide good user experience
- ✅ Code is readable and well-organized

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ **Importing repositories directly in pages**
   - ✅ **Do**: Use use cases in pages
   - ✅ **Do**: Instantiate use cases with repository dependencies

2. ❌ **Using `any` type in TypeScript**
   - ✅ **Do**: Define proper types for all variables, functions, and return values
   - ✅ **Do**: Let TypeScript guide you to correct implementations

3. ❌ **Mixing server and client code incorrectly**
   - ✅ **Do**: Understand when to use `"use client"` directive
   - ✅ **Do**: Keep server components as default (they're more efficient)
   - ✅ **Do**: Only use client components when you need interactivity, hooks, or browser APIs

4. ❌ **Skipping data mapping**
   - ✅ **Do**: Convert Supabase database types to domain entities
   - ✅ **Do**: Don't pass database types directly to components
   - ✅ **Do**: Create mapping functions in repository implementation

5. ❌ **Forgetting error handling**
   - ✅ **Do**: Handle errors in repository methods
   - ✅ **Do**: Use Next.js `notFound()` for missing resources
   - ✅ **Do**: Show user-friendly error messages

6. ❌ **Not understanding the dependency flow**
   - ✅ **Do**: Remember: Pages → Use Cases → Repositories → Database
   - ✅ **Do**: Never let repositories depend on pages or components
   - ✅ **Do**: Keep domain layer (core) independent of other layers

7. ❌ **Hardcoding data instead of using Supabase**
   - ✅ **Do**: Always fetch data from Supabase
   - ✅ **Do**: Remove any dummy/mock data before completion

8. ❌ **Ignoring TypeScript errors**
   - ✅ **Do**: Fix all TypeScript errors before considering the project complete
   - ✅ **Do**: Use TypeScript as a guide, not an obstacle

9. ❌ **Not testing on different devices**
   - ✅ **Do**: Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - ✅ **Do**: Use browser dev tools to simulate different screen sizes

10. ❌ **Creating components that are too large**
    - ✅ **Do**: Break down complex components into smaller, reusable ones
    - ✅ **Do**: Keep components focused on a single responsibility

11. ❌ **Not using Next.js Image component**
    - ✅ **Do**: Use Next.js `Image` component for all images
    - ✅ **Do**: This provides automatic optimization and lazy loading

12. ❌ **Forgetting to set up RLS policies in Supabase**
    - ✅ **Do**: Enable Row Level Security on your tables
    - ✅ **Do**: Create policies that allow public read access

13. ❌ **Not handling loading states**
    - ✅ **Do**: Show loading indicators while data is being fetched
    - ✅ **Do**: Use loading skeletons for better UX

14. ❌ **Passing functions or class instances to client components**
    - ✅ **Do**: Convert classes to plain objects before passing to client components
    - ✅ **Do**: Call methods (like `format()`) on the server before serialization

15. ❌ **Not organizing code properly**
    - ✅ **Do**: Keep related files together
    - ✅ **Do**: Use clear, descriptive names for files and folders
    - ✅ **Do**: Follow consistent naming conventions

### Learning Resources

**Documentation:**
- Next.js App Router documentation
- Supabase JavaScript client reference
- Tailwind CSS documentation
- TypeScript handbook

**AI Assistance:**
- You can use AI tools to help with:
  - Understanding concepts and patterns
  - Debugging errors
  - Generating code (but understand what it does)
  - Explaining TypeScript errors
- Don't just copy-paste code; make sure you understand it

### Final Notes


Focus on understanding why we structure code this way, not just making it work. The patterns you learn here are used in production applications.

You can organize your folder structure however makes sense to you.

Good luck.
